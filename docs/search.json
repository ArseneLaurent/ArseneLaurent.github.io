After selecting the relevant variables and plotting, distinguishing athlete nationality by color and separating into 4 different graphs based on category. From these plots, we can notice that while winning times have decreased slightly for the Men and Women categories over the past 4 decades, times for the Wheelchair Women and Wheelchair Men categories have dramatically improved in the same amount of time.\nWe can also see that men generally have shorter times than women in either category, and that the winners for the past decade or so have consistently been from the same countries in each category, meaning that each category has a couple of countries that consistently dominate.\nHere is a link to the original data repository by nrennie on GitHub: https://github.com/nrennie/LondonMarathon"

    "text": "This data comes from the 2022-01-18 folder of the TidyTuesday GitHub repository. After selecting the relevant variables and creating a graph with average rating as our y-axis and Country on the x-axis, we can see that companies based in Chile had the highest average rating for their chocolate bars. Unfortunately, this data is highly skewed by the fact that there were only two Chilean companies who had their chocolate bars rated. Below is a graph plotting all of the data, showing which country’s companies had the highest rated chocolate bars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this plot doesn’t offer us much more information on which country produces the “best” chocolate, though we can observe that the highest rated chocolate is pretty consistently within the 60-80\\(%\\) range of cocoa concentration.\nHere is a link to the original data by Brady Brelinski: https://flavorsofcacao.com/chocolate_database.html"

This can range from using AI to automatically filter out duplicate applications to using AI to evaluate whether a candidate is suitable for a job, whether that be by simply cross referencing the applicant’s resume and the job requirements, or fully using AI to select highly valued candidates after being trained to be able to distinguish between different values of candidates."
