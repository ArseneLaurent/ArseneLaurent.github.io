After selecting the relevant variables and plotting, distinguishing athlete nationality by color and separating into 4 different graphs based on category. From these plots, we can notice that while winning times have decreased slightly for the Men and Women categories over the past 4 decades, times for the Wheelchair Women and Wheelchair Men categories have dramatically improved in the same amount of time.\nWe can also see that men generally have shorter times than women in either category, and that the winners for the past decade or so have consistently been from the same countries in each category, meaning that each category has a couple of countries that consistently dominate.\nHere is a link to the original data repository by nrennie on GitHub: https://github.com/nrennie/LondonMarathon"

    "text": "In this project, I originally wanted to calculate the probability of getting a royal flush in texas hold em poker. I then pivoted to the probability of being dealt a blackjack in blackjack. This was an idea that was more appealing to me, but I then realized that that probability was much too trivial. I then pivoted again to calculating the probability of winning versus the dealer in blackjack, using standard playing strategy where both the dealer and the player don’t hit past 17.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\nsimulate_blackjack_game &lt;- function() {\n\n  deck &lt;- c(rep(2:10, 4), rep(10, 12), rep(11, 4)) \n  deck &lt;- sample(deck, length(deck), replace = FALSE)\n  \n\n  player_hand &lt;- deck[1:2]\n  dealer_hand &lt;- deck[3:4]\n  deck &lt;- deck[-(1:4)] \n  hand_total &lt;- function(hand) {\n    total &lt;- sum(hand)\n    num_aces &lt;- sum(hand == 11)\n  \n    while (total &gt; 21 & num_aces &gt; 0) {\n      total &lt;- total - 10\n      num_aces &lt;- num_aces - 1\n    }\n    \n    return(total)\n  }\n  \n \n  while (hand_total(player_hand) &lt; 17) {\n    player_hand &lt;- c(player_hand, deck[1])  \n    deck &lt;- deck[-1] \n  }\n  player_total &lt;- hand_total(player_hand)\n  \n\n  while (hand_total(dealer_hand) &lt; 17) {\n    dealer_hand &lt;- c(dealer_hand, deck[1]) \n    deck &lt;- deck[-1] \n  }\n  dealer_total &lt;- hand_total(dealer_hand)\n\n  if (player_total &gt; 21) {\n    return(\"Loss\") \n  } else if (dealer_total &gt; 21 | player_total &gt; dealer_total) {\n    return(\"Win\") \n  } else if (player_total == dealer_total) {\n    return(\"Push\") \n  } else {\n    return(\"Loss\") \n  }\n}\n\n\nnum_simulations &lt;- 100000\nresults &lt;- map_chr(1:num_simulations, ~ simulate_blackjack_game())\n\n\nwin_prob &lt;- mean(results == \"Win\")\nloss_prob &lt;- mean(results == \"Loss\")\npush_prob &lt;- mean(results == \"Push\")\n\n\ncat(\"Estimated probability of winning:\", win_prob, \"\\n\")\n\n\nEstimated probability of winning: 0.40932 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Estimated probability of losing:\", loss_prob, \"\\n\")\n\n\nEstimated probability of losing: 0.48924 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Estimated probability of a push (tie):\", push_prob, \"\\n\")\n\n\nEstimated probability of a push (tie): 0.10144 \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Result = c(\"Win\", \"Loss\", \"Push\"), Probability = c(win_prob, loss_prob, push_prob))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = Result, y = Probability, fill = Result)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Estimated Probabilities in Single-Deck Blackjack\", y = \"Probability\", x = \"Game Outcome\") +\n  theme_minimal() + theme_solarized(light = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph here shows us that, using a standard strategy, the player has around an 8% greater chance of losing than winning. This tells us that, though the standard strategy is decent, allowing for a win around 40% of the time, it would be prudent for the player to look to employ a more advanced strategy. This would involve basing the decision on whether to hit or stand on the cards that the dealer has been dealt, rather than solely basing that decision on the sum of the player’s own cards. Even more advanced strategy cold involve counting cards, but in a casino scenario or even amongst friends such a strategy could get the player into serious trouble."

    "text": "This data comes from the 2022-01-18 folder of the TidyTuesday GitHub repository. After selecting the relevant variables and creating a graph with average rating as our y-axis and Country on the x-axis, we can see that companies based in Chile had the highest average rating for their chocolate bars. Unfortunately, this data is highly skewed by the fact that there were only two Chilean companies who had their chocolate bars rated. Below is a graph plotting all of the data, showing which country’s companies had the highest rated chocolate bars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this plot doesn’t offer us much more information on which country produces the “best” chocolate, though we can observe that the highest rated chocolate is pretty consistently within the 60-80\\(%\\) range of cocoa concentration.\nHere is a link to the original data by Brady Brelinski: https://flavorsofcacao.com/chocolate_database.html"
