    "title": "Ethics of AI in the Hiring Process",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The use of AI in the hiring process is becoming ever more prominent as advances in the technology are made. This can range from using AI to automatically filter out duplicate applications to using AI to evaluate whether a candidate is suitable for a job, whether that be by simply cross referencing the applicant’s resume and the job requirements, or fully using AI to select highly valued candidates after being trained to be able to distinguish between different values of candidates. Using AI in the hiring process comes with its own set of ethical dilemmas though. Amazon found that its hiring AI was discriminating against women, despite never being explicitly taught to do so.\nAmazon had originally wanted to teach their AI to return the top few most promising candidates when given a list of applications. However, they inadvertently trained the AI to prefer male applicants over females. The data used to train the AI was collected over the course of 10 years and consisted of applications that the company had received during that period of time. This means that, while consent was not explicitly given by the people who submitted those applications, the resumes were willingly handed over to Amazon, who then used them to train their AI program. From what the Reuters article describes, none of the applications were excluded from being used to train the AI.\nHowever, there is an issue with the data being used nonetheless. When using data, especially when used to train AI into recognizing certain patterns and then apply them, it is of utmost importance to ensure that the data being used accurately represents the group that the AI will be asked to evaluate. In Amazon’s case though, the majority of applicants were men due to how male-dominated the tech industry is. Dastin mentions this, saying that “… Amazon’s computer models were trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Most came from men, a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry.” This means that when the AI was learning the patterns it was supposed to be recognizing and applying, it developed a preference for male candidates.\nIn general, using AI to evaluate candidates for a position runs the risk of falling into dangerous biases in the same way that Amazon did. An article from the University of Southern California mentions how AI might be used to hire people based on their proximity to the company they applied to. While companies might use this information to hire locals or those who could have shorter commutes and therefore be more easily available should there be an issue, this runs the risk of becoming discriminatory against minorities. If the AI is trained on applications that come from people who live in rich white neighborhoods, it could quickly begin to disqualify applications that come from people who live in minority communities but that are just as, if not more, qualified for the position.\nIt’s also important for people to be aware of what their data is being used for when using people’s data for anything, including training AI programs. As mentioned previously, while applicants willingly handed over their data, they likely were not made aware of exactly what their data was going to be used for after they were taken into consideration for the position. Informed consent could have been possible by adding a required field to the application that asks if the applicant is willing to submit their data for use in AI training, though that might open up other hidden biases in the training of the program. It’s difficult to provide informed consent for unseen applications, but as long as the use of the data doesn’t stray too far from being used to train the AI, what the AI does with that training is well within the boundaries of informed consent.\nCitations:\n\nDastin, Jeffrey. “Amazon Scraps Secret AI Recruiting Tool That Showed Bias against Women.” Reuters, 11 Oct. 2018, www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G/.\nUniversity of Southern California. “Artificial Intelligence in HR: How AI Is Changing Hiring | USC Online Communication Degree.” Communicationmgmt.usc.edu, 15 Nov. 2023, communicationmgmt.usc.edu/blog/ai-in-hr-how-artificial-intelligence-is-changing-hiring."

From these plots, we can notice that while winning times have decreased slightly for the Men and Women categories over the past 4 decades, times for the Wheelchair Women and Wheelchair Men categories have dramatically improved in the same amount of time.\nWe can also see that men generally have shorter times than women in either category, and that the winners for the past decade or so have consistently been from the same countries in each category, meaning that each category has a couple of countries that consistently dominate.\nHere is a link to the original data repository by nrennie on GitHub: https://github.com/nrennie/LondonMarathon, scraped from Wikipedia (1 November 2022) on London Marathon winners, and general data."

I then pivoted to the probability of being dealt a blackjack in blackjack. This was an idea that was more appealing to me, but I then realized that that probability was much too trivial. I then pivoted again to calculating the probability of winning versus the dealer in blackjack, using standard playing strategy where both the dealer and the player don’t hit past 17.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\nsimulate_blackjack_game &lt;- function() {\n\n  deck &lt;- c(rep(2:10, 4), rep(10, 12), rep(11, 4)) \n  deck &lt;- sample(deck, length(deck), replace = FALSE)\n  \n\n  player_hand &lt;- deck[1:2]\n  dealer_hand &lt;- deck[3:4]\n  deck &lt;- deck[-(1:4)] \n  hand_total &lt;- function(hand) {\n    total &lt;- sum(hand)\n    num_aces &lt;- sum(hand == 11)\n  \n    while (total &gt; 21 & num_aces &gt; 0) {\n      total &lt;- total - 10\n      num_aces &lt;- num_aces - 1\n    }\n    \n    return(total)\n  }\n  \n \n  while (hand_total(player_hand) &lt; 17) {\n    player_hand &lt;- c(player_hand, deck[1])  \n    deck &lt;- deck[-1] \n  }\n  player_total &lt;- hand_total(player_hand)\n  \n\n  while (hand_total(dealer_hand) &lt; 17) {\n    dealer_hand &lt;- c(dealer_hand, deck[1]) \n    deck &lt;- deck[-1] \n  }\n  dealer_total &lt;- hand_total(dealer_hand)\n\n  if (player_total &gt; 21) {\n    return(\"Loss\") \n  } else if (dealer_total &gt; 21 | player_total &gt; dealer_total) {\n    return(\"Win\") \n  } else if (player_total == dealer_total) {\n    return(\"Push\") \n  } else {\n    return(\"Loss\") \n  }\n}\n\n\nnum_simulations &lt;- 100000\nresults &lt;- map_chr(1:num_simulations, ~ simulate_blackjack_game())\n\n\nwin_prob &lt;- mean(results == \"Win\")\nloss_prob &lt;- mean(results == \"Loss\")\npush_prob &lt;- mean(results == \"Push\")\n\n\ncat(\"Estimated probability of winning:\", win_prob, \"\\n\")\n\n\nEstimated probability of winning: 0.41052 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Estimated probability of losing:\", loss_prob, \"\\n\")\n\n\nEstimated probability of losing: 0.48806 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Estimated probability of a push (tie):\", push_prob, \"\\n\")\n\n\nEstimated probability of a push (tie): 0.10142 \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Result = c(\"Win\", \"Loss\", \"Push\"), Probability = c(win_prob, loss_prob, push_prob))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = Result, y = Probability, fill = Result)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Estimated Probabilities in Single-Deck Blackjack\", y = \"Probability\", x = \"Game Outcome\") +\n  theme_minimal() + theme_solarized(light = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph here shows us that, using a standard strategy, the player has around an 8% greater chance of losing than winning. This tells us that, though the standard strategy is decent, allowing for a win around 40% of the time, it would be prudent for the player to look to employ a more advanced strategy. This would involve basing the decision on whether to hit or stand on the cards that the dealer has been dealt, rather than solely basing that decision on the sum of the player’s own cards. Even more advanced strategy cold involve counting cards, but in a casino scenario or even amongst friends such a strategy could get the player into serious trouble."
